Developed for an open-ended clustering assignment for my machine learning class.

The goal of this model is to cluster League of Legends champions based on their in-game base stats 
in order to classify them under their respective role according to the LoL role classification system.
(e.g., Controller, Fighter, Mage, Marksman, Slayer, Tank, Specialist).
